## Meteor-Madness

A newly identified near-Earth asteroid, "Impactor-2025," poses a potential threat to Earth, but do we have the tools to enable the public and decision makers to understand and mitigate its risks? NASA datasets include information about known asteroids and the United States Geological Survey provides critical information that could enable modeling the effects of asteroid impacts, but these data need to be integrated to enable effective visualization and decision making. Your challenge is to develop an interactive visualization and simulation tool that uses real data to help users model asteroid impact scenarios, predict consequences, and evaluate potential mitigation strategies.
